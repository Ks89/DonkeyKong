Piazzolla of Politecnico di Milano for the course called \"Computer Graphics\" in 2012.\r\n\r\n**I modified this software to extends funcionalities, like movement, interactions and i created a sprite of Donkey Kong and another one for the princess.**\r\n\r\n**This software requires a library** created by M. Gribaudo and P. Piazzolla **that i can't release because explicitly forbidden by the authors.**\r\n\r\nI decided to realese this \".c\" file, because i worked on this for many days and i implemented lots of features respect the original version distributed during the course in 2012.\r\n\r\n**Obviously, you can't download this and compile.**\r\n\r\nSorry guys, but the authors wrote in the gaSim sources this: \"To be used only for the Computer Graphics course\". I can't release the gaSim library.\r\n\r\n# Video\r\n\r\n[![ScreenShot](http://www.stefanocappa.it/publicfiles/Github_repositories_images/DonkeyKong/7-youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NGgnF8ltNo)\r\n\r\n# Install with Dev-C++ (Windows XP)\r\n\r\n1.
