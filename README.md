# DonkeyKong

A little game created by Marco Gribaudo and Pietro Piazzolla of Politecnico di Milano for the cource called "Computer Graphics" in 2012.
I modified this software to extends funcionalities, like movement, interactions and i created a sprite of Donkey Kong and another one for the princess.

This software requires a library created by Marco Gribaudo and Pietro Piazzolla that i can't release because explicitally forbidden by the author.

I decided to realese this ".c" file, because i worked on this and i implemented lots of features respect the original version distributed during the course in 2012.

Obviously, you can't download this and compile.

Sorry guys, but the author wrote in the gaSim sources this: "To be used only for the "Computer Graphics" course".
